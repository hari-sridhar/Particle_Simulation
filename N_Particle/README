## Particle Grid Initialization

This program initializes a grid of particles with the following features:

1. **User Input**:
   - The number of particles is inputted by the user.

2. **Randomized Initial Positions**:
   - #Particles' initial positions are randomized but adhere to a fixed inter-particle spacing to avoid overlap.

3. **Randomized Radii**:
   - #Radii of particles are randomized within specified bounds (e.g., `min_radius` and `max_radius`).

4. **Modeling and Calculation of forces acting on the particles**
    - # The summation of forces acting on the particles describes their future position, trajectory and velocity of the particles at any instant of time

### Key Steps:
- The particles are arranged in the form of a grid.
- The algorithm ensures no two particles overlap by maintaining a fixed inter-particle distance.
- Both position and radii randomness are controlled within user-defined limits.
- Force calculation is performed by solving non-linear ODEs against the particle
